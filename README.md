First Attempt at GitHub-Wish me luck!
Hello all! My name is Jack and I am from Los Angeles, California. I am new to data science, but have been teaching myself the basics using an IBM platform and online courses through coursera. I am always on the hunt for ways to learn more about coding and analytics, so if anyone out there has any advice or recommendations, they will not be wasted on me. Thanks, hope to hear from some of you.
